At the moment I'm checking for events (such as keypresses/mouselicks)
on every frame. This is not really the way I should be doing it. I should
be handling the events asynchronously in a separate thread. In order not to
have a race conditions when updating the state of the game I'm going to need
to use MVars or some such mechanism.

However, I'll do this later. I've put it in the TODO file.
