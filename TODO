TODO

[ ] Build and deploy to Android. Have a look at this:
     https://github.com/neurocyte/ghc-android

[ ] I need to get the radii of the germs right, which I think is going
   to be a bit of a chore. The problem is that the edges of the germs are
   Bezier curves where the control points lie outside the actual
   physical edge of the curve. (The control points lie on what I'll dub the
   "notional radius" of the germs.) Unless I calculate what the outermost point
   of the germs are using Bezier maths I can't really know what the *true*
   radius of the germs is. Since the notional radius is used for collision
   detection it looks like the germs are colliding when their edges aren't
   touching. Perhaps this isn't a problem, and I can live with it. It's
   not like the collisions where ever going to be "pixel perfect".

[ ] I'd like to add a blur effect to the game to make it truly look like
   a petrie dish. It's going to be hard to get the performance acceptable.
   After just a little preliminary reading I don't think I just want to do
   a Guassian blur but rather to use a more sophisticated depth of field
   effect or "bokeh" effect.

[ ] I need to create a playground in which Rauri can make the germs look
   better.
      - Docker
      - blog posts to teach him about Haskell
      - crib the Cairo wrapper from Helm.

[ ] I want the antibiotics to be dragged and dropped on top of the germs
   and to have an area of effect that is not the complete screen. As the
   antibiotics get less potent they fade in colour until they become
   clear eventually.
