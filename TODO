High priority
-------------

[ ] Add back blogs to centres of germs.

[ ] Center the level finished text.

[ ] Increase the doubling speed so you can't just stay in level 1

[ ] Fix the memory leak

[ ] Start respecting AppDidEnterBackground events and put the game in a
    quiescent state.

[ ] Only draw what is absolutely necessary on the non-playing state screens.
    Try to keep gsRenderDirty False as much as possible.

[ ] Cache the antibiotic graphic so it's not redrawn every time.

[ ] Look at the battery usage of the game on Android.

[ ] Remove the status bar on iOS version

[ ] Game does not save state when you hit home button to pause. Reported
    by Andy. Check.

[ ] Add liquid from bottle sound effect for antibiotics

[ ] Change the z-index on the germ being dragged!

Low priority
------------
[ ] Refactor the GameState to be opaque so that you can hide annoying
    stuff like the gsRenderDirty/gsRender pair behind one concept.

[ ] Android: Rethink using external storage to decompress assets. It requires
    a permission.

[ ] add an effect where the screen cracks when you get infected.

[ ] Create a script to do what GHC flag -staticlib does on Mac OS X.
    See Ivan Perez's email.

[ ] Art: Make it looks like we're looking through a microscope.

[ ] Start using lenses. e.g. for enabling antibiotics

[ ] Art: Add a "dirty screen" effect via a shader

[ ] Rename Physics event to Idle event.

[ ] Turn GLScript into a free monad too.

[ ] Speed up the algorithm to search and kill germs


[ ] Blur effect: I'd like to add a blur effect to the game to make it truly look like
   a petrie dish. It's going to be hard to get the performance acceptable.
   After just a little preliminary reading I don't think I just want to do
   a Guassian blur but rather to use a more sophisticated depth of field
   effect or "bokeh" effect.



----
DONE
----
[X] Make sure germ being dragged stays in bounds!

[X] BUG: Solve the problem of the "action bar" showing on the game.

[X] Only kill germs affected by antibiotic


[X] Figure out loading of assets on Android. Unzip and load.

[X] Put a delay in when it's running at 60fps. Don't want to consume too
    much power.

[X] Add Score field

[X] Keep antibiotics showing when you've finished the level

[X] Get iOS build going. Update for TestFlight

[X] Fix GLFun type to use pre-defined attribute locations instead of
    re-calculating each time. (See GraphicsGL.hs)

[X] When handling multiple events Step as far as FSM state change and then
    wipe the rest.


[X] Make the type Either Quit [Event] not Maybe [Event]


[X] Refactor runPhysicsHandler. Was previously updating state with
    old state. Pattern

     bes <- readIORef besRef
     writeIORef $ ...

     is inherently dangerous
[X] Don't cache the germ's position

[X] Build and deploy to Android. Have a look at this:
     https://github.com/neurocyte/ghc-android
    (Took approximately a week of hell. Perhaps 70+ hours)
